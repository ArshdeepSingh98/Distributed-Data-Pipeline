# Realtime Data Streaming | End-to-End Data Engineering Project
I built an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that acts as a comprehensive guide through each stage of data managementâ€”from ingestion and processing to storage. I utilized a robust tech stack comprising Apache Airflow, Python, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Spark, and Cassandra. I containerized the entire system using Docker to streamline deployment and enhance scalability.

## Technologies

- PostgreSQL
- Docker

## Run 
Run Docker Compose to spin up the services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
